# Shen-clj

A Clojure port of the Shen Language (https://github.com/Shen-Language/shen-sources)

## Status

Not fully working yet. The Repl loads and we can execute most instructions.

## Generating Clojure source

To generate the clojure source from the KLambda source, run `lein run`. This will overwrite `src/shen/functions.clj`

## Running

To run the shen repl just run `lein shen-clj`
